            <blockquote>
              I was having some friends over for dinner, which usually gets
              complicated because I have friends who are meat-eaters,
              vegetarians, vegans, and pescatarians. Itâ€™s a lot of work to cook
              separate foods for all these special diets, but then, I came
              across Caybana Moon Jerk Sauce and Marinade. I followed some of
              their recipes on their Web site, carolinapacificfoods.com, and my
              dinner party was so much easier than in the past. I simply got out
              a bunch of zip-top bags, and put either the mild or spicy Caybana
              Moon Jerk Sauce and Marinade into each bag. Then, I put chicken
              pieces in one bag, tofu and jackfruit in another, and shrimp,
              scallops and fish in the third bag. After marinating them for a
              little while, I baked them in the oven. I served a big tossed
              salad, which everyone could eat, and served a fresh fruit platter
              for dessert. Everybody raved about the Caybana Moon Jerk Sauce and
              Marinade, whether it was the mild or spicy, and for the first
              time, cooking for all these friends with different diets was easy!
